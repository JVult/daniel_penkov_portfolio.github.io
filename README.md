# Daniel_Penkov_Portfolio
A compilation of my past projects/ projects I've worked on. All of my current projects have been made as example/learning projects and have not been launched onto a public server.
The front-end in most of the projects is pretty barebones. I am mostly a back-end developer and the front-end in the projects is there just to test functionalities. 

# Project 1: Revolut-like WEB API
* Creating a WEB API for a Revolut-like banking company.
* The project handles interest using background services.
* The project allows users to make transactions and handles them.
* The project works with multiple currencies and has conversion features.
* The above two features have an inbuilt fee which is calculated via formula.
* The project contains a bank treasury which is used for handling interest and fees.
* The project uses MVC and a Repository model. All of the important classes in the project have a private inbuild Update method.
* Used technology - C#, ASP.Net 6, Swagger
 
# Project 2: "Top Tire"
* Creating a WEB Store for a wheel/tire selling company.
* The project handles users, guests and administrators and has appropriate restrictions to said roles.
* The project displays a catalogue of wheel entries that have a name, price, available amount and a picture. The project allows administrators to create custom entries.
* The project uses a simple account wallet to handle purchases.
* The project contains a "cart" feature that let's you store wanted items and purchase them all at once.
* The project also contains a "wheel repair" option that allows users to book repairs on wheels they've already bought.

# Project 3: Betting Website
* Creating a gambling website that is based on currency-to-currency ratio courses and changes.
* The project handles users, guests and administrators and has appropriate restrictions to said roles.
* The project's database contains currency pairs which are guided by an inbuilt algorithm which changes their value and saves the new value in the database as a new entry.
* This constant flow of information is fed to a graph on the site which shows all of the pairs course.
* Using this graph users can be on the course of the currency pairs. They can bet on what the currency pair ratio will be in a set amount of time.
* The project contains a treasure which handles financial payouts and losses.
* Used technology - C#, ASP.Net 6 , HTML, JavaScript (chart js).
